# SWEN90017 - 2024 - Team002 - Transcription Aide

## Project Overview

### Introduction
This project aims to develop a transcription platform that operates in a local environment using OpenAI's Whisper software. The platform is designed for a team working within a secure local area network (LAN), allowing team members to upload audio files for transcription without the need for user login.

### Key Components
#### 1. Web Interface
- **File Upload**: A simple web interface enables users to upload audio files directly to the local machine.
- **User Simplicity**: No login is required, making the process straightforward for team members.
- **Email Input**: Users can provide an email address to receive the transcription once it's completed.

#### 2. Local Machine Execution
- **Transcription Software**: The local machine runs OpenAI's Whisper software to transcribe the uploaded audio files.
- **Speaker Identification**: The transcription process includes diarisation to identify different speakers within the audio.
- **Output Format**: The primary output is a readable text file (.txt) that captures the transcription with identified speakers and timing.

### Deployment & Performance
- **Secure LAN**: The platform is deployed within a secure local area network to ensure data privacy.
- **Scalability**: The platform can handle the transcription of multiple files concurrently.
