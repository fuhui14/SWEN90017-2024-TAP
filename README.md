# SWEN90017 - 2024 - Team002 - Transcription Aide

## Project Overview

### Project Goal
This project aims to build a transcription platform in a local environment based on OpenAI's Whisper software.  

​The platform has two main components: 

1.  **Web Interface**: A simple web interface that allows users to upload audio files to a local machine to execute the transcription software.  

2.  **Local Machine Execution**: The local machine processes the uploaded audio files and generates readable transcriptions, identifying different speakers.  

​The web platform is designed to be simple and does not require a login, as it will be used within a team in a local network.
