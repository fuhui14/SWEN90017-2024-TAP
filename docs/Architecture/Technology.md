|  Django   | A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. | - **Integration-Friendly**: Django's robust ecosystem allows seamless integration with AI libraries like OpenAI Whisper. <br> - Batteries-included: Comes with built-in features for admin interface, authentication, ORM, etc. <br> - Strong community support and extensive documentation. | - Monolithic: Can be heavyweight for small projects. <br> - Steeper learning curve due to its comprehensive nature. |    Yes   |
|   Flask   | A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.                      | - **Flexibility**: Easy to integrate with OpenAI Whisper and other AI libraries. <br> - Minimalistic: Provides simplicity and ease of use. <br> - Modular and easy to extend. | - Requires additional libraries for full-stack capabilities. <br> - Less opinionated, which can lead to inconsistencies in large teams. |    No    |
|  Tornado  | A Python web framework and asynchronous networking library, originally developed at FriendFeed. | - **Performance**: Non-blocking and asynchronous, making it suitable for handling real-time audio processing with OpenAI Whisper. <br> - Good for applications needing high concurrency. | - Steeper learning curve for asynchronous programming. <br> - Smaller ecosystem compared to Django or Flask. |    No    |
|  Pyramid  | A flexible Python web framework suitable for both small and large applications. | - **Scalability**: Can scale with the project size, making it adaptable to evolving needs. <br> - Allows easy integration with different components, including AI libraries like Whisper. | - Less out-of-the-box features compared to Django. <br> - Requires more configuration, which can slow down initial development. |    No    |
| CherryPy  | A minimalist Python web framework, object-oriented and designed for rapid development. | - **Lightweight**: Minimalist design allows direct integration with Whisper without unnecessary overhead. <br> - Fast and easy to deploy. | - Lacks built-in features, requiring manual integration of many components. <br> - Smaller community and less documentation. |    No    |
