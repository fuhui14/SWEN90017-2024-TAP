# Transaction Aide Platform (TAP) Code Review Standards

## 1. Objectives of Code Review

The primary objectives of conducting code reviews in the TAP project include:

- **Improving Code Quality**: Ensure that the code is robust, understandable, and maintainable.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitate knowledge transfer among team members which includes 
  understanding of the overall system and specific components.
- **Error Identification**: Catch and fix errors early in the development process which might be 
  missed during initial coding and testing phases.
- **Standardization**: Ensure that the code meets the predefined coding standards and guidelines.

## 2. Scope of Code Reviews

All code pushed to the main branches of our repositories must undergo review. This includes but is not limited to:

- New Features
- Bug Fixes
- Refactoring Changes
- Documentation Updates

## 3. Code Review Process
The code review process in the TAP project involves the following steps:

### Preparation

- Reviewers should allocate sufficient time to perform a thorough review.
- Authors should annotate source code before the review to provide context and rationale for 
  significant decisions.

### Review

- Use the pull request (PR) feature on GitHub.
- Comment directly on lines of code and provide constructive feedback.
- Discuss alternative approaches where applicable.

### Fixes and Follow-ups

- The author addresses the comments and makes necessary changes.
- If significant changes are made, a second round of reviews may be necessary.

### Approval and Merge

- At least two approvals are required from senior developers for the PR to be merged.
- Automated tests must pass before merging.

### 4. Review Checklist

Reviewers should consider the following checklist:

- **Correctness**: Does the code correctly implement the intended functionality?
- **Design**: Is the code well-designed and appropriate for the system architecture?
- **Efficiency**: Does the code produce efficient outcomes without unnecessary complexity?
- **Testing**: Is the code well-tested? Are there any obvious missing tests?
- **Readability and Style**: Is the code easy to read and understand?
- **Documentation**: Is the code adequately documented, especially public APIs and non-obvious 
  logic?
- **Security**: Does the code introduce any security vulnerabilities?
- **Compliance**: Does the code adhere to the specified coding standards and guidelines?

## 5. Common Issues to Look For

- Logical Errors
- Performance Issues
- Unnecessary Complexity
- Repetition and Redundancy
- Potential Bugs
- Styling Issues

## 6. Feedback and Continuous Improvement
- **Constructive Feedback**: Focus on the code, not the author. Be specific and provide context.
- **Regular Retrospectives**: Hold regular retrospectives to discuss the code review process and 
  make adjustments as needed.
