## What Went Well

- **Effective Collaboration**: Our team demonstrated strong collaboration across different roles, 
  successfully completing all assigned tasks within the sprint timeframe.

- **Clear Sprint Goals**: All key deliverables, including personas, user stories, lo-fi and hi-fi 
  prototypes, and acceptance criteria, were completed and met stakeholder expectations.

- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: The positive feedback from stakeholders, especially regarding the 
  user stories and prototypes, indicates that the teamâ€™s outputs were well-aligned with the 
  client's needs.

## What Could Be Improved

- **Feedback Loop**: While the review process was thorough, incorporating more frequent check-ins 
  with stakeholders and end-users during the sprint could lead to continuous improvements and 
  early detection of potential issues.

## Action Items for Improvement

- **Enhanced Time Estimation Techniques**: Implement more detailed time estimation techniques, such 
  as breaking down tasks into smaller sub-tasks, to improve accuracy in future sprints.

- **Early Stakeholder Involvement**: Schedule regular stakeholder check-ins, perhaps mid-sprint, to 
  gather feedback early and make necessary adjustments before the final review.

- **Focus on Continuous Feedback**: Increase the frequency of internal feedback sessions within the 
  team, ensuring that everyone is aligned and that potential issues are addressed as soon as 
  they arise.

## Lessons Learned

- **Balanced Task Allocation**: Ensuring that task allocation is well-balanced among team 
  members is crucial for maintaining steady progress and preventing bottlenecks.

- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engaging stakeholders earlier and more frequently throughout the 
  sprint can significantly enhance the quality and relevance of the outputs.
