## What Went Well

- **Clear Goal Alignment and Focus on Must-Have Features:** The team maintained a sharp focus 
  on "must-have" features, ensuring that core functionalities, such as file uploads and 
  transcription processing, were implemented with priority. All members demonstrated commitment 
  to completing high-priority tasks aligned with user stories and acceptance criteria.

- **Strong Collaboration Between Front-End and Back-End Teams:** Regular communication and 
  alignment on API design and data formats facilitated a smooth integration process between the 
  front-end and back-end. The teams made excellent use of tools like Postman for mock API 
  testing, which minimized integration challenges.

- **Timely Risk Mitigation and Problem Solving:** The team identified potential issues with 
  OpenAI Whisper and the speaker library early on, allowing them to adapt and proceed with 
  integration without significant delays. Performance risks on the front-end were successfully 
  mitigated through optimized file handling and lazy loading strategies.

- **Improved Testing and Code Review Practices:** Continuous testing was prioritized throughout 
  the sprint, with dedicated members performing unit, API, and integration tests. Code reviews 
  were conducted effectively, ensuring that all tasks were thoroughly checked by team members 
  before being marked as complete.

## What Could Be Improved

- **Handling Unexpected Task Complexity:** Some tasks, especially those involving integration 
  with external libraries, turned out to be more complex than initially anticipated. In future 
  projects, allocating more time for research or creating prototypes early could better address 
  such complexities.

- **Improving Task Management:** A few tasks experienced slight delays due to underestimating 
  the effort required. Breaking down complex tasks further could help improve time estimation 
  and prevent task overload. Involving more team members in large or challenging tasks could 
  have ensured better task distribution and faster progress.

- **Enhancing Communication During Testing:** Although testing was a strong focus, better 
  documentation of testing results would have improved the team's ability to track bugs and 
  ensure all issues were addressed promptly. More frequent integration tests earlier in the 
  sprint could have reduced the stress of final sprint-day tests.

## Lessons Learned

- **Proactively Address Complex Tasks:** Start researching and experimenting with challenging 
  technologies early in future sprints to uncover potential issues sooner.

- **Further Optimize Task Breakdown and Estimation:** Break down tasks more granularly and 
  involve the whole team in time estimation sessions to improve accuracy and planning.

- **Improve Communication During Testing:** Standardize the process for documenting and sharing 
  testing results to ensure that issues are quickly identified and resolved.

- **Conduct Integration Testing Early and Frequently:** Increase the frequency of integration 
  tests to ensure smoother transitions between development phases and minimize last-minute bugs.
