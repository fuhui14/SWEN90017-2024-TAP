## What Went Well

- **Comprehensive System Architecture Diagrams:** All architecture diagrams were completed on 
  time with high quality, contributing significantly to the clarity of the project structure. 
  Diagrams such as class, sequence, and ER diagrams aligned well with user stories and 
  prototypes, providing a solid foundation for development.

- **Effective Collaboration Among Team Members:** Each member fulfilled their assigned roles 
  efficiently, demonstrating great teamwork across front-end and back-end teams. The planning 
  and timely communication ensured smooth execution of tasks.

## What Could Be Improved

- **Diagram Consistency and Alignment with the Motivation Model:** While individual diagrams 
  were well-prepared, there is room to improve consistency across diagrams to avoid 
  discrepancies. Establishing a checklist or peer-review process will help maintain alignment 
  and ensure diagrams reflect the same logic and motivation.

- **Alignment of Motivation Model and User Stories:** Further cross-referencing the motivation 
  model with user stories is needed to ensure all design elements support user needs and align 
  with the development objectives.

- **Incomplete Tasks and Priority Adjustment:** Some development tasks for Epic 1 (e.g., 
  front-end and back-end development, unit tests, API, and integration tests) were not completed.
  These tasks will be carried over to Sprint 3 and prioritized to avoid further delays.

- **Documentation Proofreading:** Minor spelling and wording errors were noted. A more thorough 
  review of documentation before submission will enhance professionalism and communication clarity.

## Action Items for Improvement

- **Implement Peer Reviews for Diagram Consistency:** Establish a peer-review process for 
  diagrams to ensure they align with the motivation model and user stories.

- **Carry Over Incomplete Tasks with High Priority:** Incomplete tasks from Sprint 2 will be 
  prioritized in Sprint 3 to ensure they are addressed promptly.

- **Optimize Time Management:** Break down larger development tasks into smaller, manageable 
  subtasks to improve estimation accuracy and ensure smooth progress.

## Lessons Learned

- **Prioritization of Tasks:** Tasks must be regularly reviewed and adjusted based on progress 
  to avoid task overload and ensure smooth delivery within sprint timelines.

- **Value of Iterative Feedback:** Continuous improvement through frequent feedback loops with 
  stakeholders strengthens project outcomes and facilitates seamless transitions between sprints.
