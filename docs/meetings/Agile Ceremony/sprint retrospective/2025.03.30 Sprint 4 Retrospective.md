## **What Went Well**

- **Early Start on Sprint 5 Tasks:** In addition to completing most Must Have stories, the team proactively began Should Have features like multilingual support and admin portal download. This helped reduce upcoming workload and improve timeline flexibility.

- **Strong Ownership and Initiative:** Team members independently initiated and followed through on new tasks such as refining the queue system and improving upload support, demonstrating maturity and responsibility.

- **Improved Testing Awareness:** Unit and integration tests were started early. Although not fully complete, the early attention to quality laid a solid foundation for future sprints.

## **What Could Be Improved**

- **Delayed Progress on High-Effort Back-End Tasks:** Stories like speaker identification and file auto-deletion remain unfinished due to their complexity. The team underestimated required effort and may need to further break down or re-prioritize large tasks.

- **API Freeze Timing Was Too Late:** Constant changes in history and download APIs caused frontend rework. Establishing a fixed deadline for endpoint changes earlier in the sprint would help reduce churn.

- **Testing Execution Needs More Follow-Through:** While awareness improved, some tests (especially unit and regression tests) were not completed on time due to competing development priorities.

## **Lessons Learned**

- **Prioritize Large and Critical Tasks Early in the Sprint:** Starting high-effort stories (e.g., US2.4, US4.2) at the beginning will allow more buffer time and reduce backlog accumulation.

- **Define API Freeze Points Mid-Sprint:** Setting an API freeze mid-way through the sprint can help stabilize development and prevent cascading rework.

- **Separate Testing Ownership from Development:** Assign dedicated owners for test tasks to ensure test plans are fully executed even while others are deep in development.

- **Continue Leveraging Early Integration:** The benefits of early testing and API alignment were clear—this approach should continue and be expanded in future sprints.
