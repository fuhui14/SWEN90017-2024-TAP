## **What Went Well**

- **Completion of All Development Goals:** All user stories planned for Sprint 5 were completed, including frontend, backend, and testing tasks. This ensured the system reached feature-complete status and was ready for final validation in Sprint 6.

- **Full Testing Pipeline Established:** The team successfully delivered comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and security tests. This was the first sprint where testing was truly parallel with development.

- **Effective API Freeze Enforcement:** A mid-sprint API freeze was enforced for the first time, which significantly reduced frontend-backend misalignments and enabled stable integration.

- **Team Autonomy & Initiative:** Multiple team members took ownership of tasks and resolved blockers independently, allowing the sprint to run smoothly with minimal reassignments or delays.

### **Others**

| Actions                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| Risk assessment for endeavor exhibition       |
| Started to build poster for endeavor exhibition |
| Added a bug report documentation to record bugs |

> These tasks were originally planned for Sprint 6 but were proactively initiated and progressed during Sprint 5, demonstrating strong time management and forward thinking.

## **What Could Be Improved**

- **Test Data Quality:** Some test cases used unrealistic or redundant data, which caused false negatives in early integration testing. A stronger test data design process is needed moving forward.

- **Staging Deployment Communication:** Although the staging environment was deployed on time, access instructions and verification checklists were not distributed clearly to all team members.

## **Lessons Learned**

- **Start documentation in parallel with final development:** Even if just rough outlines, beginning documentation early reduces crunch in Sprint 6.

- **Define test data schemas with QA leads:** This ensures realistic scenarios and avoids repeated refactoring of test inputs.

- **Formalize staging verification process:** A shared checklist and notification system (e.g., Slack, email) can help the whole team validate the environment together.

- **Encouraging forward-looking contributions is valuable:** The extra progress made on Sprint 6 items (exhibition prep, bug log, risk tracking) helped reduce the future burden and reflected strong initiative.
