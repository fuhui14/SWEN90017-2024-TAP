## Risk for Sprint 1

### 1. Ambiguity in User Requirements
- Risk: Misunderstanding or incomplete understanding of user requirements can lead to incorrect 
  persona creation, user stories, and prototypes.
- Mitigation: Regular check-ins with the product owner and client to clarify and confirm 
  requirements. Ensure thorough documentation and feedback loops.

### 2. Time Constraints
- Risk: The timeline for Sprint 1 is tight, and there may not be enough time to complete all 
  tasks, particularly the development of both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes.
- Mitigation: Prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency. Focus on completing critical 
  tasks first and be prepared to roll over less critical tasks to the next sprint if necessary.

### 3. Technical Challenges
- Risk: Technical difficulties, particularly with the integration of OpenAIâ€™s Whisper software 
  and diarisation technology, could delay progress.
- Mitigation: Conduct early technical research and prototyping to identify potential issues. 
  Allocate additional time for testing and troubleshooting.

## Other Notes
- Ensure alignment with client requirements discussed in the meeting on 2024.08.06.
- Review and refine user stories and prototypes in upcoming sprints.
- Unfinished actions will delay to the next sprint.
