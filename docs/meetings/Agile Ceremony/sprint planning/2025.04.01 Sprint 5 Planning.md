- Performance, logging, and admin security are prioritized in backend.

###  **Testing becomes a major focus**
- All unit and integration tests must be complete.
- System will be deployed to staging for full end-to-end testing in Sprint 6.

## **Final Deliverable Timeline**
- **Sprint 5 (Week 7 end):** All features delivered and verified in staging.
- **Sprint 6 (Week 10 end):** System fully tested, documented, and ready for client handover.
