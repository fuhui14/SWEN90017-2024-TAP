## Risk for Sprint 2

### 1. Misalignment Between Design and Development
- Risk: Integration of diagrams and documentation into the project may not be seamless, leading 
  to misalignment between design and development.
- Mitigation: Regularly sync through stand-up meetings to ensure alignment and address any 
  discrepancies immediately.

## 2. Technical Challenges
- Risk: Technical challenges may arise during the implementation of key modules.
- Mitigation: Discuss issues immediately with the team.

## 3. Tasks Overload
- Risk: Team members may be overloaded with tasks, leading to burnout and decreased productivity.
- Mitigation: Monitor workload closely and redistribute tasks if necessary, ensuring that no 
  team member is overwhelmed.

## Other Notes
- All design diagrams must be approved by the team and be usable in subsequent development.
- Ensure alignment with user stories and fidelity prototypes.
- Review and refine user stories and prototypes in upcoming sprints.
- Unfinished actions will delay to the next sprint.
