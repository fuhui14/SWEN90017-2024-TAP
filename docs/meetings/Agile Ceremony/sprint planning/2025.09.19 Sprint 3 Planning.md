## Risk for Sprint 3

### 1. Integration Challenges Between Front-End and Back-End
- Risk: Integrating the front-end and back-end can often be tricky, especially if the API design 
  isn't well-coordinated or the data format differs from expectations.
- Mitigation: 
  - Ensure early alignment on API design and data format between front-end and back-end teams.
  - Create detailed API documentation before starting development to avoid mismatches.
  - Regularly test the integration with mock APIs (using tools like Postman) before the back-end 
    implementation is finalized.

## 2. Underestimated Task Complexity
- Risk: Some tasks, especially those involving external libraries (like OpenAI Whisper or 
  Speaker library), might turn out to be more complicated than anticipated.
- Mitigation: Start with researching and experimenting with complex tasks (like integrating 
  Whisper) early in the sprint to uncover potential issues.

## 3. Front-End Performance Issues
- Risk: The front-end may suffer from performance issues due to the handling of large files (e.g.
  , audio files) during the upload or playback processes.
- Mitigation: 
  - Optimize the file upload process to handle larger files asynchronously.
  - Use lazy loading for any heavy resources or files.
  - Ensure that front-end code is optimized, and perform tests on large audio files to ensure 
    smooth processing.

## 4. Incomplete Test Coverage
- Risk: Lack of adequate testing could lead to critical bugs or integration issues being 
  discovered late in the sprint.
- Mitigation:
  - Set up clear goals for unit testing, API testing, and integration testing.
  - Dedicate specific team members to testing tasks, ensuring that all critical paths are covered.
  - Prioritize code reviews and continuous testing throughout the sprint rather than at the end.
  - Ensure that no task is marked as "done" without a proper code review from at least one other 
    team member.

## Other Notes
- Since this is the last sprint, the focus should be on delivering a fully functional product 
  rather than aiming for new features or technical perfection. It's essential to ensure that 
  the "must-have" features are completely polished and working.
- Ensure alignment with user stories, fidelity prototypes, and acceptance criteria.
- Conduct frequent integration tests between the front-end and back-end teams. Any API changes 
  should be communicated immediately to ensure no breaking changes affect the overall functionality.
