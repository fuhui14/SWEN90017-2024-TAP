## **Challenges and Risks Addressed**

### API Instability Mitigation
- Mid-sprint API freeze was enforced, minimizing late frontend breakages.

### Testing Ownership Clarified
- QA leads on both frontend and backend drove complete test suite delivery.

### Backend Load Risks Resolved
- Load and concurrency testing revealed and resolved bottlenecks in DB queries.

---

## **Next Steps**

- Enter Sprint 6, focused solely on validation, documentation, client review, and delivery.
- Finalize regression, penetration, and acceptance testing.
- Prepare and submit user manual, test report, and final handover documentation.
- Conduct user acceptance demo and receive client approval.
