## Feedback from Stakeholders

### Positive Feedback:

- The stakeholders were pleased with the comprehensive architecture diagrams and the progress on the file upload functionality.
- The team demonstrated flexibility by refining each diagram and aligning them with user stories & fidelity prototypes as they progressed. This iterative approach not only strengthened the project outcome but also positioned the team to seamlessly transition into the next sprint.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

- Suggestion to conduct the usability test (high-fidelity prototype) with the client as soon as possible.
- It is essential to regularly review the consistency between diagrams (e.g., class, sequence, domain diagrams) to ensure they align with the motivation model.
- Establish a checklist or peer-review process to catch any discrepancies early and ensure all diagrams represent the same logic and structure.
- To enhance coherence, the motivation model should be cross-referenced with the user stories. This will ensure that the diagrams and architecture design support the functionality described in the user stories.
- Some minor issues with spelling errors and word choice were identified. It is important to conduct thorough reviews of all documentation to maintain professionalism and ensure communication is clear.
- A few tasks related to Epic 1 development were not completed within this sprint. These tasks should be carried over to Sprint 3 and elevated to the highest priority to avoid project delays.

## Next Steps

### Plan for Upcoming Sprint:

- Conduct Usability Test
- Develop user stories for the priority of "Must Have"
- Separate development of front end and back end
- Relevant tests
- Integrate back end and front end
