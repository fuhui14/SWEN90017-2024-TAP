## Sprint Goals Review

### Sprint Goal:

- Develop user stories for the priority of "Must Have" features.
- Separate development of the front-end and back-end.
- Perform relevant tests.
- Integrate back-end and front-end functionality.

### Achievement Status: **Partially Completed** 

Core functionalities were implemented, but some tasks required additional time and will carry 
over to post-sprint tasks.

## Demonstration of Completed Work

## Challenges and Risks Encountered

### Integration Between Front-End and Back-End:

- Coordination between front-end and back-end teams proved challenging, leading to slight delays 
  in testing and integration.
- **Mitigation:** Regular sync meetings and mock API testing will help ensure smooth completion in 
  the next sprint.

### Testing Coverage:

- While unit and API testing was completed, integration and acceptance testing require more time 
  to ensure all components work seamlessly.
- **Mitigation:** Integration testing will be prioritized in the next sprint, along with completing 
  the acceptance test.

## Next Steps

- Conduct acceptance testing and integration testing to ensure all functionalities are working 
  as expected.
- Focus on polishing and optimizing the product to meet the requirements outlined in the user 
  stories and prototypes.
