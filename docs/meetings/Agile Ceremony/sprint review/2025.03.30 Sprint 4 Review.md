## **Sprint Goals Review**

### **Sprint Goals:**
- Complete all remaining *Must Have* user stories.
- Begin development of selected *Should Have* stories to reduce Sprint 5 workload.
- Improve front-end and back-end integration, begin performance optimization.
- Lay the foundation for final testing phase by starting unit and integration tests.

### **Achievement Status:** **Mostly Completed**

Most of the Must Have user stories (e.g., file upload, email notifications, history view) were completed. Some Should Have features (e.g., multilingual support, file download) have also started early. Testing and integration progressed in parallel, laying a solid foundation for Sprint 5.

## **Challenges and Risks Encountered**

### **High workload on back-end tasks**
- Several tasks (e.g., multilingual support, speaker ID) are complex and system-wide, causing slow progress.
- **Mitigation:** Sprint 5 will focus development resources and break down these tasks by priority.

### **API inconsistency during early integration**
- Frequent API changes (e.g., file download, history view) caused repetitive frontend adjustments.
- **Mitigation:** Enforce API freeze policy in Sprint 5 and daily API alignment meetings.

### **Testing coverage insufficient**
- While testing has started, the current test coverage is still behind plan.
- **Mitigation:** Dedicated testers will be assigned in Sprint 5 to accelerate coverage expansion.

---

## **Next Steps**

- Complete key back-end tasks.
- Continue enhancing unit and integration testing for reliability.
- Optimize API performance and DB queries to prepare for load testing.
- Begin full Sprint 5 development with a focus on system robustness and completeness.
