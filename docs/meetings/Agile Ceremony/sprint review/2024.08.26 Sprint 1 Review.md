## Feedback from Stakeholders

### Positive Feedback:

- Stakeholder is satisfied with both the user stories and the prototype, stating that everything
seems good.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

- Suggestion to display an expiration date in the History Transcriptions table for each file,
indicating how long the transcription files will be available (since they are kept only for 30 
  days).

## Next Steps

### Plan for Upcoming Sprint:

- Create System Architecture Diagrams
- Implement Key Modules - Epic 1: File Upload
- Tests
- Acknowledge Whisper's function
