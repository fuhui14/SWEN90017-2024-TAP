#### Discuss project progress

  - Sequence Diagram
  - Use Case Diagram

#### Discuss improvements of project
**From Mingye:**
- An additional diagram is needed: Architecture Diagram (a combination of Deployment Diagram and Component Diagram)
- Document the research process and outcomes
- Create test documentation based on Acceptance Criteria
- Add detailed instructions in the code review section of the Git commit standards file
- Ensure consistent naming conventions for files (e.g., capitalization, underscores)


**From Leon:**
- Motivational Model:
  - Too detailed (e.g., interface, file upload)
  - Fix typos (e.g., "differentiation," "smooth" instead of "smoothly")
  - Ensure consistent capitalization
  - Carefully choose descriptive words:
    - Avoid terms like "educated" and "reasonable"
    - Define and validate terms like "fun" with the client
- Deepen client engagement to address details, rather than surface-level communication
- Ensure consistency among all diagrams (e.g., align epics in the Use Case Diagram with the Motivational Model)
- Arrange review tasks for diagrams


#### Individual contribution presentation

- Yingrong Chen and Claire Shou completed the presentation
