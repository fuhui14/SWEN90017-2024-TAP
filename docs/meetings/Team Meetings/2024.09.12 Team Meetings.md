## Discussion Notes

#### Discuss project progress

- Assigning review tasks for all diagrams
- Modified the motivation model and use case diagram to ensure the consistency
- Added backend configuration document
- Added code review process document

#### Discuss peer review for next few weeks

- In Week 12
- Team LYT (Musta) will report on Team TAP. 
- Team TAP will report on Team VPA.

#### Check the consistency for diagrams

**Feedback From Leon:**

- Domain model should be more complicated. The relations and entities of current model is too 
  simplified.
- Domain model should align with motivation model. Each entity should be inherited from motivation 
  model.
- Each diagram should NOT be the reflection of the minimum workload for this project.
- The text on the diagram should demonstrate the entities is represented clearly.

#### Check next steps for Sprint 2

- Risk management document: Distinguish the risk as "technology part" and "non-functional part"
- Try to end Sprint 2 with usability test for hiFi.

#### Individual contribution presentation

- Pengyuan Yu and Fuhui Yang completed the presentation
