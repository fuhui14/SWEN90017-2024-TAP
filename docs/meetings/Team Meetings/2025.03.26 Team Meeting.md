## Agenda

## Discussion Notes

### 1. Springt4 Progress and Frontend/Backend Coordination
  - Most of the expected features for Springt4 have been successfully implemented.
  - The merge between frontend and backend still needs more work.
  - A few minor display bugs on the frontend should be fixed soon.
  - Frontend testing is mostly completed. Future updates will follow any changes in frontend class design.
  - The backend's voice recognition needs better speaker identification.
  - The system for processing multiple audio files in a queue also needs improvement.


### 2.  Upcoming Tasks
   - Everyone needs to prepare their individual progress updates. Keep them simple and include visuals (e.g. images or screenshots).
   - Be ready for a short impromptu speech during the group meeting. Think of a rough idea or theme in advance.
