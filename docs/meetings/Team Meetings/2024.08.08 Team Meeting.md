## Discussion Notes
#### Review Requirements
- Reviewed the requirements built from the previous client meeting.
- Confirmed that the requirements align with the client's needs and expectations.
#### Persona Creation
- Decided to create a single Persona, "Researcher," due to the lack of clear differentiation between students and researchers.
- Agreed to write a descriptive narrative under the Persona instead of just a graphical representation.
#### Motivation Model
- Discussed the need to complete the Motivation model.
- Assigned tasks to ensure all elements of the model are thoroughly covered.
#### Design Patterns and Architecture
- Identified the need to determine which design patterns to use for the project.
- Discussed the classes needed, encapsulation strategies, and managing cohesion.
- Agreed to create UML diagrams, ER-diagrams, and their descriptions to visualize the architecture.
#### Testing Strategies
- Decided on using various testing methods: unit tests, black-box tests, UI tests, branch tests, and flow tests.
- Emphasized the need for comprehensive documentation of the Acceptance criteria, including detailed steps and results (PASS or FAILED).
