## Discussion Notes

### 1. Feedback from Peer Group Audit

| Feedback Area                         | Comments                                                                                                    | Suggested Improvement                                                     |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Class Diagram**                     | The **Transcribe** class is too large. Components like **email** should be in separate classes.             | Break down the Transcribe class into smaller components.                  |
| **Architecture Consistency**          | Inconsistent architecture diagrams, likely due to different tools. Some diagrams missing in `.md` files.    | Ensure consistency across diagrams and include all in `.md` files.        |
| **Requirements & Motivational Model** | Well-received. However, the **mood board** feels like a list of options. Requirements page is hard to read. | Rename the mood board and use a table format for requirements.            |
| **User Story and Justification**      | Clear and well-done. **Security** part could be expanded.                                                   | Expand the security aspect in the user stories.                           |
| **Technical Research**                | Specification and testing sections were good, but **security** is missing.                                  | Include a section on security in technical research.                      |
| **Module Distribution**               | Clear module distribution, but the **API** definition needs work.                                           | Refine and better define the API.                                         |
| **Testing & Risk Management**         | Good coverage, but lacks priority levels and triggers for tests.                                            | Add priority levels (high, medium, low) and clarify triggers for testing. |
| **High-Fidelity Prototype**           | Aligns well with design document, clear **lo-fi** prototype.                                                | Add **error handling** in high-fidelity prototype.                        |


### 2. Supervisor Review of Usability Test  
   The supervisor reviewed the usability test documentation and video, providing positive feedback. No major issues were highlighted, and the test was well-received.

### 3. Testing Plan for the Week
- This week, the team needs to focus on completing the Acceptance Criteria Test.
- Other tests:
  - Integration Test is a must.
  - Unit Test and Structural Test are highly recommended to ensure system stability.
### 4. Plan for Final Team Presentation (Week 12)
   The Final Team Presentation is scheduled for Week 12, and the recommended structure includes:

- Team and Project Overview (First and last speaker).
- Requirements and Key Functional/Non-Functional Requirements.
- Architecture (with diagrams).
- Front-end and Back-end Structure with documentation, including API examples and deployment details.
- Testing (QA): Unit, integration, and UI tests.
- Live Demo: Include architectural complexity and deliverables.
- Agile Process: Breakdown of how Agile was applied, including challenges and sprints.
- Plan for Semester 2 and Summary. 
  

**Key sections for the presentation:**
- Kanban board screenshots and burndown charts.
- Live Demo of the system.
- Architecture Diagram is a must; other diagrams are optional.
- Key Challenges to be discussed later.


### 5. Upcoming Deliverables and Client Communication
- The final report slides and some front-end pages need to be ready for the supervisor by next week.
- As the semester end approaches, the team should communicate with the client, informing them of what was accomplished during the semester and advising them of the teamâ€™s absence from Melbourne for the next three months.
