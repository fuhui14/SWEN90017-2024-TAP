## Agenda
- Review front-end user feedback
- Discuss transcription result improvements
- Clarify issue tracking and documentation process

---

## Discussion Notes
- **Front-end improvements suggested:**
  - Add a **progress bar** to indicate upload/transcription progress.
  - **Speaker numbering** should start from *Speaker 1* instead of *Speaker 0* for clarity.
  - The **“Go to history section”** instruction on the result page is confusing—needs clearer reference or visual link.
  - On the transcription page, the **“Confirm”** button label is ambiguous and needs to be more intuitive.
  - Clarify the **email input** purpose by using a proper label like “Email address to receive transcription result” rather than just a helper sentence.

- **Transcription result issues:**
  - Transcription accuracy and formatting still need improvement—continue to optimize.

- **General reminders:**
  - Capture issues immediately during development or testing and record them properly.
  - Use **GitHub Issues** to document actual issues or bugs found, not just user stories.
