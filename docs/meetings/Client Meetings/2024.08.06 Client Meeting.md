## Question & Answer


#### Q: As mentioned in the slides, it takes Raspberry Pi 5 around 9 hours to transcribe a 1-hour audio file. So how much time do you expect our system to process the same file? (Pengyuan Yu)

A: 4 hours would be great and it would be better if less than that.

#### Q: Do we need to store the result in the local database or in another format. If so, should they be kept indefinitely, or is there a retention policy? (Pengyuan Yu)

A: Short term backup is okay. Store in local database for a couple of weeks or a month.

#### Q: Which core features do you expect the platform to have? For example, are file upload, transcription status monitoring, transcription result download or email delivery, and speaker identification sufficient?  (Yingrong Chen)

A:

#### Q: Additionally, when you mentioned a "simple web interface," what exactly do you mean by a "simple" interface? Do you mean having a simple color design and minimal interactive buttons (like only buttons for uploading files, downloading transcripts, and sending transcripts via email)? (Yingrong Chen)

A: File upload is a must. Transcription status is essential. We just need an email to deliver the result. The most challenging thing is identify the speaker. We expect a clear interface.

#### Q: What security measures do you expect us to implement for the platform, especially considering it will be used within a secure LAN? Are there any specific security protocols we should follow? (Claire Shou)

A: I don't know. they have some protocals to follow. Maybe we can use a certain range of IP addresses. Security is important because our research data is private.

#### Q: Are there any specific performance requirements for the application? For example, do you expect it to handle a certain number of concurrent users or process a certain amount of data within a given time frame? (Claire Shou)

A: No need for high concurrency. it will be good for 3 people to transcribe at the same. In addition, if there are more files need to be transcribed, we need a queue system to handle this.

#### Q: What are the expected input file formats for the application? Should it support audio files only, or are other formats like video or text files also required? (Claire Shou)

A: Optional but we need to implement audio first.

#### Q: For the frontend design, can we use frameworks? Do you recommend us to use any specific framework? (Lecheng Chen)

A: No limitations.

#### Q: do you have any requirements for the web interface's interactivity? For example, should we implement drag-and-drop functionality for file uploads? Do we need to make this project accessible on mobile platforms, or should it only be implemented for desktop use? (Lecheng Chen)

A: Optional yes for the web interface's interactivity. Only for desktop use and no need to implement mobile version.

#### Q: Whisper currently outputs the transcription as a single line of text. Do you need the text to be formatted into more readable paragraphs or sentences? (Fuhui Yang)

A: Yes.

#### Q: Do you have specific expectations regarding the accuracy of speaker identification(in terms of Whisper's confidence level)? (Fuhui Yang)

A: I don't have such expectations.

#### Q: Do you need the speaker's timestamps to be marked in the transcription results? (Fuhui Yang)

A: (skip)

#### Q: Noticing that you mentioned in the introduction slides, does the platform need regular backups? If so, do you have any preferred frequency or method for the backups? (Fuhui Yang)

A: Short term backup is okay. Store in local database for a couple of weeks or a month. We can have an admin portal where I can see at least the list of files or something I can download as the files.

#### Q: For the function of identifying different speaker, can we use other open source library on GitHub base on OpenAI Whisper? (Zixuan Zhang)

A: Yes.

#### Q: Considering future project updates, are there any requirements for the language used in backend server development? (Zixuan Zhang)

A: No limitations as long as it works.

#### Q: For the output results, what other file formats do you expect, such as pdf, jpg? (Zixuan Zhang)

A: Up to you. Readable and editable text file is the minimum requirement.

#### Q: If other open source libraries can provide both translation and voiceprint recognition, do we still need to use Whisper for the implementation? (Jiangyu Chen)

A: (skip)

#### Q: Does this project have any special performance requirements, such as the need to address high concurrency or handle large files, etc.? (Jiangyu Chen)

A: There is no high concurrency need in the context of research team. We can regard that the audio file is at most 4-hour long.

#### Q: When identifying speakers, how specific do the details need to be? Is noting their gender sufficient, or is it also necessary to include a description of their voice type? (Yongjie Ba)

A: Only content and distinguish them using speaker 1, 2 and 3.

#### Q: Could you provide us with some user cases in various scenarios? (Yongjie Ba)

A: We do research in residential care and will have group conversations. Many of them we record on the phone or in a recorder that then I connect just to my computer through a USB cable, and we need the transcriptions then to analyze them for research. So then we, we collect that qualitative data that we need the transcriptions to analyze, and then produce our research outputs. 

#### Q: Should the system include automated alerts or notifications for users when transcriptions are complete or if there are issues during processing? （Tianyi Zhong)

A: Yes, through email notification. Process bar in web is not necessary.

#### Q: Although there is no login section, do you think it would be good if we save the transcription history? If the user wants to access the history, our system could send a link to his email account; then, the user can access the history interface through the link. （Tianyi Zhong)

A: Not necessary to maintain the history for a long time. We can go through the history in last 30 days. Besides, we can keep our whisper up-to-date but this is optional.
