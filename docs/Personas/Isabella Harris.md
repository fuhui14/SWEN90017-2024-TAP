![poster](<images/Isabella Harris.png>)

## Background

For this persona, we wanted to capture a user who is a seasoned researcher specializing in social sciences and policy analysis. They often participate in various meetings, both online and in-person, and need to compile and edit meeting notes afterward. Given the sensitive nature of the discussions they’re involved in, they are highly concerned about data privacy and confidentiality. They require a tool that can quickly and accurately provide transcribed text from these meetings, making it easier for them to analyze and organize the content.

## Goals

-   Quickly and accurately transcribe meeting audio into text, allowing for easy editing and analysis.
-   Clearly distinguish between different speakers in the transcription to avoid confusion.
-   Securely save and manage transcription records, ensuring data privacy. 
-   Enjoy a straightforward and user-friendly experience that minimizes the time she spends on technical operations.

## Challenges

-   Many apps’ transcription feature is inaccurate and fails to effectively differentiate between speakers. 
-   Isabella is wary of most online transcription tools due to concerns about data privacy and security.
-   Although OpenAI's Whisper has improved transcription quality, it is inefficient at processing long audio files and lacks convenient record management features.
-   Many platforms have overly complex operations, which increase the workload.
  
## Uses for the Platform

"The user will be able to achieve high standards of accuracy and efficiency in transcriptions, all while ensuring that their data remains secure and private. The platform's design eliminates the need to upload files to untrusted third-party platforms, allowing the user to focus on their work with confidence in the security and integrity of their sensitive information."
