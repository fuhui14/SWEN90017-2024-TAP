Reference Transcript (Ground Truth):
```
Speaker 1: In the past, learning English as a separate subject seemed relatively easy.

Speaker 2: The textbook selected and graded items of language which
were put into content and then practiced intensively.

Speaker 1: New items were carefully controlled so that the student could cope quite easily.

Speaker 2: Now that English issued as a medium of instruction, however, all this has changed.
```

## Milestone 1

Date: 5 March, 2025

### Objective: 
Initial transcription and speaker assignment functionality implementation

### Implementation Details:
1. Loads and preprocesses audio (format conversion, noise reduction).

2. Transcribes audio segments with timestamps via the Whisper model.

3. Splits audio into silence-based chunks, computes embeddings (Resemblyzer), and clusters speakers (DBSCAN).

4. Aligns text segments to speaker clusters and merges adjacent segments by speaker.

### Major Changes:

- Introduced `transcribe_audio` function for robust audio transcription, handling cross-platform path conversion and error management.

- Developed `assign_speakers_to_transcription` logic, including segmentation, embedding, clustering, and merging of speaker-labeled text.

### Results:
```
Speaker 0: In the past, learning English as a separate subject seemed relatively easy.

Speaker 1: The textbooks selected and graded items of language which were put into content and then practiced intensively.

Speaker 2: New items were carefully controlled so that the students could cope quite easily.

Speaker 0: Now that English issued as a medium of instruction, however all this has changed.
```

### Analysis:

- The generated version incorrectly identifies three speakers instead of the two present in the ground truth, and slightly alters phrasing compared to the reference transcript.

- Speaker 0 and Speaker 1 swap in the forth line; the model introduced a Speaker 2.

- The generated phrases (“learning English” vs. “Naming English”; “issued” vs. “used”) indicate minor semantic drift.

- Overall structure is maintained, but speaker mapping and exact wording require refinement to match the expected output precisely.

### Challenges:

- Ensuring accurate alignment between transcription segments (in seconds) and silence-based chunk times (in milliseconds), solved by consistent unit conversion.

- Handling low-volume or noisy segments required adding a noise reduction step (Noisereduce) before chunking.

### Next Steps:

- Integrate real-time streaming support for transcription and speaker assignment.

- Optimize DBSCAN parameters to reduce over-segmentation in speaker clustering.

## Milestone 2

Date: 26 March, 2025

### Objective: 
Streamline transcription and speaker diarization using an integrated ASR-diarization pipeline

### Implementation Details:

1. Converted input audio to WAV format.

2. Initialized OpenAI’s Whisper-based ASR-Diarization pipeline (speechbox.ASRDiarizationPipeline) with hardware-aware device selection (CUDA, MPS, or CPU) and Hugging Face authentication.

3. Ran the pipeline end-to-end to produce time-stamped speech transcripts annotated with speaker segments.


### Major Changes:
- Replaced separate transcription and embedding pipeline with a single ASR-Diarization model call to simplify code and improve consistency.

- Added environment-based token loading for secure access to Hugging Face models.


### Results:
```
Speaker 1:  In the past naming English as a separate subject seemed relatively easy.

Speaker 0:  The textbooks selected and graded items of language, which were put into content and then practiced intensively.

Speaker 1:  New items were carefully controlled so that the students could cope quite easily.

Speaker 0:  Now that English used as a medium of instruction, however, all this has changed.
```

### Analysis:

- The pipeline identifies two speakers, consistent with the ground truth.

- The phrasing in the first line lacks the term “learning”, using “naming” instead, indicating a drop in lexical accuracy.

- The final phrase uses “used” rather than “issued”, mirroring the semantic drift observed in Milestone 1.

- Overall, the integrated pipeline simplifies processing and maintains correct speaker count, but speaker-to-label alignment and exact text fidelity need fine-tuning.

### Challenges:
- Managing model authentication tokens securely via environment variables.

- Handling large audio files within a single pipeline call, resolved by pre-converting inputs to WAV and splitting at runtime.

- Significant processing time due to model initialization and single-pass diarization, impacting real-time applicability.

### Next Steps:
- Compare diarization accuracy against the custom speaker embedding approach.

- Tune pipeline parameters (e.g., chunk size, overlap) to improve temporal segmentation precision.


## Milestone 3

Date: 15 April, 2025

### Objective:
 Enhance speaker segmentation granularity using continuous embeddings and spectral clustering

### Implementation Details:
1. Converted audio to WAV and preprocessed raw waveform for embedding extraction.

2. Used Resemblyzer’s `embed_utterance` with `return_partials=True` to obtain continuous speaker embeddings and corresponding time splits.

3. Applied spectral clustering (`SpectralClusterer`) on the continuous embeddings to detect change points and assign speaker labels dynamically.

4. Generated a labeling timeline by grouping consecutive frames with identical cluster labels.

5. Trimmed segments via FFmpeg (`trim_audio`) and transcribed each with Whisper “base” model, aggregating speaker-tagged text.

### Major Changes:
- Moved from silence-based DBSCAN clustering to embedding-driven spectral clustering for finer speaker boundary detection.

- Introduced continuous embedding extraction (`return_partials=True`) to capture intra-speaker variation over time.

- Automated audio trimming with FFmpeg to precisely isolate speaker turns before transcription.

### Results:
```
Speaker 0: In the past learning English as a separate subject seemed relatively easy.

Speaker 1: The textbooks selected and graded items of language which were put into content and then practiced the intent.

Speaker 0: New items were carefully controlled so that the students could cope quite well.

Speaker 1: easily. Now that English used as a medium of instruction however
```

### Analysis:
- The pipeline correctly detected two speakers, matching the ground truth.

- In the second segment, “practiced the intent” is inaccurate; the expected phrase is “practiced intensively”, indicating a misrecognition of “intensively”.

- The third line retains correct meaning but changes “quite easily” to “quite well”, a minor semantic variation.

- The final segment’s word order is broken (“easily. Now that English used…”), and “used” remains incorrectly substituted for “issued”, showing residual model bias.

- While speaker boundaries are precise, text fidelity suffers from punctuation, phrase truncation, and word substitution errors.

### Challenges:
- Spectral clustering on large embedding sequences can be memory-intensive, requiring downsampling or limiting max clusters.

- Synchronizing continuous embeddings with exact audio timestamps introduced minor alignment drift, addressed via midpoint-based labeling.

### Next Steps:
- Benchmark clustering parameters (min_clusters, max_clusters) to balance over- and under-segmentation.

- Experiment with different Whisper model sizes (e.g., “medium”) for improved transcription accuracy.

- Implement incremental processing to handle long recordings without full in-memory embedding storage.



## Milestone 4

Date: 4 May, 2025

### Objective:
Maximize transcription speed and accuracy using faster-whisper with Pyannote diarization and integrated cleanup

### Implementation Details:
1. Converted audio to WAV and applied noise reduction with `noisereduce`.

2. Performed speaker diarization using Pyannote’s pretrained pipeline, extracting labeled time segments.

3. Loaded faster-whisper `WhisperModel("medium")` for low-latency transcription with beam search.

4. Iterated through diarized segments, slicing audio via `tqdm`-monitored buffer reads and FFmpeg-free extraction.

5. Collated raw segment transcripts, applied `cleanup_transcripts` (punctuation insertion, merging) and `format_transcripts` (timestamp formatting, speaker indexing) utilities.

### Major Changes:
1. Switched to faster-whisper for faster inference while maintaining Whisper’s accuracy.

2. Integrated Pyannote diarization rather than manual clustering for robust speaker turn detection.

3. Implemented automatic punctuation handling in `cleanup_transcripts` to improve readability.

### Results:
```
Speaker 1: In the past, learning English as a separate subject seemed relatively easy.

Speaker 2: the textbook selected and graded items of language which were put into content and then practiced intensively

Speaker 1: new items were carefully controlled so that the students could cope quite easily.

Speaker 2: now that english issued as a medium of instruction, however, all this has changed
```

### Analysis:
- The final pipeline correctly segments and labels the two speakers in alignment with the ground truth.

- Transcription fidelity is high: “learning English” and “practiced intensively” match expected phrasing.

- Cleaner punctuation and merged segments yield more readable output.


## Final Summary

The development of the Transcription & Speaker Identification pipeline has progressed through four distinct milestones, culminating in a production‑ready, faster‑whisper‑powered system with accurate Pyannote‑based diarization. While key challenges around lexical precision and real‑time performance remain, the core functionality reliably delivers speaker‑tagged transcripts with high fidelity. Future work will focus on fine‑tuning accuracy, streamlining deployment, and building monitoring frameworks for continuous improvement.
