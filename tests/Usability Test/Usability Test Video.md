The usability test for the Transcription Aide Platform (TAP) was conducted to assess the ease of use, intuitiveness, and overall user experience. Participants were tasked with uploading audio files, configuring transcription settings, and managing transcription history. The test revealed several areas for improvement, particularly in file management, UI adjustments, and navigation.

The key objectives and detailed procedures from the test are outlined in the **Usability Test Plan.md**.

The results are outlined in the **Usability Test Result.md**, which will help identify usability issues and provide feedback for further improvements.
