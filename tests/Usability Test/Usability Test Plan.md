# **Usability Test Plan**

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this usability test is to evaluate the ease of use, intuitiveness, and overall user experience of the **Transcription Aide Platform (TAP)**. The test will focus on key tasks such as file upload, transcription result retrieval, and interaction with the user interface. The results will help identify usability issues and provide feedback for further improvements.

### **1.2 Scope**
The usability test will cover:
- The overall user interface (UI) and its ease of navigation.
- The functionality of core features: audio file upload, speaker identification, and result delivery.
- The interaction with the transcription process, including user input (email) and understanding of the results.

### **1.3 Objectives**
- Determine if users can upload audio files and configure transcription settings easily.
- Identify potential difficulties in understanding or interacting with the speaker identification feature.
- Assess the intuitiveness of the interface and identify any pain points or areas of confusion.

### **1.4 Participants**
The test will include participants with varied technical skill levels. The participants will simulate real users who may not be familiar with the transcription process but are tasked with using the platform.


## **2. Test Methodology**

### **2.1 Test Environment**
- The test will be conducted in a controlled environment where participants will interact with the platform on a laptop connected to a secure LAN.
- Tools such as screen recording software will be used to capture participant interactions and feedback during the test.
- The high-fidelity prototype of the TAP platform will be used for the usability test.

### **2.2 Test Scenario Overview**
Participants will be asked to complete a series of tasks representing typical user actions, including:
- Uploading an audio file containing multiple speakers.
- Inputting their email address to receive the transcription results.
- Reviewing the transcription results with speaker identification and timestamps.


## **3. Test Objectives and Tasks**

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Verify if users can upload audio files and configure transcription settings easily | Task 1: Upload a file with multiple speakers and set the transcription to be sent to an email address.                  |
| Assess if users can understand and interact with the speaker identification feature| Task 2: Review the transcription results to ensure speaker identification and timing are correctly displayed.           |
| Identify issues with navigating the user interface                                 | Task 3: Navigate through the platform and interact with the different options (upload, set email, download results).     |
| Gather overall user feedback                                                       | Task 4: Provide feedback on the overall experience, ease of use, and any areas of confusion or difficulty.              |


## **4. Test Procedure**

### **4.1 Briefing**
- Participants will be briefed on the purpose of the test. They will be informed that the test evaluates the platform's usability, not their performance.
- Instructions on each task will be provided, and participants will be encouraged to vocalize their thoughts and challenges during the process.

### **4.2 Execution**
- **Observation**: The test facilitator will observe and take notes on participants' behavior, any difficulties encountered, and overall reactions.
- **Recording**: The session will be recorded using screen capture software to review participant interactions in detail.
  
### **4.3 Post-Test Feedback**
- After completing all tasks, participants will be asked to share their feedback on their experience using the platform.
- Follow-up questions may be asked to understand their preferences, confusion points, or suggestions for improvement.


## **5. Test Metrics and Data Collection**

### **5.1 Success Criteria**
- **Task Completion Rate**: The percentage of tasks completed without errors.
- **Error Rate**: The number of mistakes participants make while trying to complete each task.
- **Time on Task**: The amount of time participants spend on each task, compared to the expected completion time.
- **User Satisfaction**: Measured via a post-test survey, where participants rate their satisfaction with the platform's ease of use and interface.

### **5.2 Data Collection Tools**
- **Screen Recording**: To capture participant actions during the test.
- **Observation Notes**: Facilitators will take notes on user behavior and challenges.
- **Survey and Follow-up Questions**: Participants will answer questions about their experience and rate their satisfaction with the system.
