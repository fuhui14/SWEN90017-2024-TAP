# **Risk Management Plan**

## **Purpose & Scope**
The Risk Management Plan outlines the approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks for the **Transcription Aide Platform (TAP)** project. By systematically managing risks, the project aims to minimize disruptions and ensure the successful completion of deliverables.

This Risk Management Plan covers all phases of the TAP project, including the design, development, and deployment stages. It applies to risks across all areas, such as technical, operational, financial, legal, and external risks. All team members are responsible for contributing to the risk management process, and the project stakeholders will be informed of any significant risks that may affect the project's success.

## **Risk Management Process**

### **Risk Identification**
Risks will be identified using the following methods:
- **Team Brainstorming**: Regular meetings to discuss potential risks based on project updates and issues encountered.
- **Client Consultations**: Discussion with the client to understand any evolving needs or challenges that could pose a risk.
- **Historical Data**: Use of past project experiences to anticipate potential problems.

### **Risk Assessment**
Each identified risk will be assessed based on:
- **Likelihood**: The probability of the risk occurring.
- **Impact**: The potential consequences or severity of the risk if it occurs.
The risks will be rated as high, medium, or low based on this analysis.

### **Risk Mitigation**
For each identified risk, the team will develop a mitigation strategy, which may include:
- **Avoidance**: Changing the project plan to eliminate the risk.
- **Reduction**: Taking steps to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.
- **Acceptance**: Acknowledging the risk and developing a contingency plan in case it occurs.
- **Transfer**: Shifting the risk to a third party (e.g., using an external service or tool).

### **Risk Monitoring and Reporting**
Risks will be continuously monitored throughout the project lifecycle. The **Scrum Master** will be responsible for updating the **Risk Register** and reporting to the project team and stakeholders during regular meetings. High-priority risks will be escalated to the client and mentor as necessary.

### **Review and Continuous Improvement**
At the end of each sprint, the team will review the risk management process and evaluate its effectiveness. Any lessons learned will be documented and applied to future sprints to improve risk identification and mitigation strategies.
